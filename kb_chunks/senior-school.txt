Senior School
Step into our Senior School and you will immediately sense our vibrant and ambitious spirit. We believe in empowering girls to throw themselves wholeheartedly into every opportunity, whether that’s delving into advanced Arts projects, taking centre stage in our compelling drama productions, competing with House spirit in sporting events, or actively shaping our school community through pupil-led committees and societies.
Beyond the Report Card – Celebrating Growth, Not Just Grades
More House Senior School is committed to supporting each girl in achieving her personal best in her GCSEs and A Levels. Our true measure of success lies in the individual progress each student makes and the confidence she gains in her own learning journey. We actively encourage girls to celebrate their own achievements, understanding that effort and growth are just as valuable as the final grade. We know that a positive and empowering school experience is fundamental to building lifelong self-esteem and a belief in oneself as a capable individual, qualities we actively cultivate to ensure our pupils thrive both now and in their future lives.
A Flourishing Environment, Where Individuality Thrives
While we are proud of our students’ academic achievements, we believe in nurturing well-rounded individuals. Our rich and varied co-curricular programme, encompassing numerous clubs, trips, and opportunities for charitable and outreach work via More Faith. It’s a privilege to see our girls explore their diverse interests, uncover their unique talents, particularly within the creative and performing Arts,  embracing the joy of discovery. Our strong House system further enriches school life, fostering friendships across year groups and providing platforms for every girl to shine outside of the academic curriculum.
Authentically More House, Warmth and Connection
Visitors often remark on the genuine and comfortable nature of our girls. When they welcome prospective families on tours, they speak with sincerity and pride, sharing their own experiences of More House with genuine enthusiasm. This authentic connection beautifully illustrates the unique atmosphere of our school, where the relationships between staff and girls are characterised by warmth, friendliness, and mutual respect.
Values that Shape Futures – Kindness, Integrity, Action
We consistently encourage our girls to consider the positive impact they have on others, understanding that their worth extends far beyond academic accomplishments. We actively celebrate kindness and consideration, promote the highest standards of behaviour, and instil the importance of integrity and proactive engagement with the world around them. These core values are integral to our assemblies, tutor time, our expectations, and our daily interactions with each pupil. Our aim is to empower our girls to become confident, compassionate young women who will make a positive difference in the wider world.
