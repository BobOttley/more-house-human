11+ Entrance
More House School is part of the London 11+ Consortium which is an association of 14 independent London day schools for girls which operates one exam across the group. The Consortium was set up to provide an application process which is fair, clear, robust and accessible to children from all schools and backgrounds.
The assessment process goes beyond testing cognitive ability alone and seeks to discover a child’s potential in creative and critical thinking, analysis, synthesis and problem-solving. For further information about the assessment process please visit the 
London 11+ Consortium
 website. This will give you further information on the Consortium itself,

Once you have completed the Registration Form you will be sent an entrance test form to find out which other schools your daughter is applying to and where she would like to sit the exam.  You will also need to send us any Educational Psychologists reports by the closing date for registrations.
At More House, we look beyond exam results and place as much emphasis on your daughter’s interview and reference from her current school. After this, your daughter will be invited to a selection morning or afternoon at More House.
