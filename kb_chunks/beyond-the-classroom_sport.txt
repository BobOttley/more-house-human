Co-curricular Sport and Physical Education forms an important and essential part of the well-balanced education offered to all More House pupils. It provides the opportunities for students to broaden their horizons and look beyond the classroom. Every girl in the school is afforded a rich programme of team activities, clubs and trips to select from, which are on offer before, during and after the school day.
The programme is run by a dedicated and highly skilled group of staff and external coaches, a number of whom have played sport at high level or more importantly achieved significant success as a coach in the development of individuals. These activities allow girls to extend their learning outside of lessons, to enjoy a new hobby, try a different sport or pursue their own healthy, active lifestyles.
Netball, hockey, football, rounders, rowing and athletics all feature within the competitive clubs schedule. Each year group enjoys a busy programme of fixtures of fixtures played against other local independent schools.
Sport at More House is rigorously structured but sympathetically balanced, offering a broad range of activities but maintaining its core belief that sport should be about participation and enjoyment. If competitive, team sports are not your thing then a host of excellent clubs such as dance, fencing, running, tennis and badminton provide activities for all to excel and enjoy.
More House girls are also encouraged to attend sporting trips throughout the school year. The sporting trips on offer range from watching the local Superleague netball team to venturing further afield for the annual ski trip.
