THE LONDON 11+ CONSOR TIUM
FAQs
Mission Statement
We aim to provide an application process which is fair, clear, robust and accessible to children from all
schools and backgrounds. We are concerned about the pressure the 11+ application system can place on
young children and the damage to learning which relentless ‘teaching to the test’ produces. We
therefore seek to run a simple process with just one test, which provides a good tool of assessment to
elicit information which can match candidates to schools best fitting their profile. We are interested not
only in verbal and mathematical potential, but also in non-verbal ability, which often signifies the sort of
creative and visual intelligence relating to problem-solving and design. The changing landscape of work
needs all these aptitudes.

Important News
The London 11+ Consortium schools have carefully reviewed the last two years’ application processes
which, driven by the uncertainty of the pandemic, necessitated a variety of assessment approaches in
2020 and adoption of the ISEB Common Pre-Test in 2021.
In 2022 we are introducing a bespoke Consortium assessment process, for all Consortium schools, which
goes beyond testing cognitive ability alone and seeks to discover a child’s potential in creative and

critical thinking, analysis, synthesis and problem-solving. This test will be 100 minutes in total and taken
in the candidate’s current school, but where this is not possible, provision will be made in all Consortium
schools for candidates to sit the test there.
The new FAQs are available now but full details including the Code of Practice and Familiarisation
Materials will be published here in the Summer Term. In the meantime please note the following Key
Dates:
●
Closing date for registrations: Friday 11th November 2022
●
Consortium Assessment dates: Friday 2nd, Tuesday 6th and Thursday 8th December 2022
●
Offer date: Friday 10th February 2023
●
Deadline to accept: 12 noon on Monday 6th March 2023
Key Facts
●
For entry to London 11+ Consortium schools in September 2023 onwards, the Consortium will be
introducing a new assessment. The assessment for September 2023 applicants will be held in
December 2022 for pupils in Year 6 at that time.
●
The assessment will include cognitive reasoning, English comprehension, Maths and some creative
new components to assess problem-solving and analysis skills.
●
Any prior knowledge assessed in the entrance examination will be based on the National
Curriculum for Year 5, but with opportunities for additional challenge built into the assessment.
●
The assessment will be taken as an
online
assessment.
Candidates do NOT need to make any
separate application for the test as Consortium schools will organise the application for them.
●
Candidates eligible for additional time will be granted this if supporting evidence is provided, in
accordance with JCQ rules, when requested by Consortium schools.
●
Candidates will
either
sit the assessment in their
current school
or
at one of the Consortium
schools to which they have applied, if their current school is unable to provide this facility.
●
Familiarisation materials will be published on the Consortium website in early Autumn Term 2022.
We recommend that all candidates look at these before taking the assessment.
FAQs
When is the new Consortium entr ance examination being introduced?
The first candidates for the new Consortium entrance examination will be Year 6 pupils sitting the test in
December 2022 for entry to Senior School in September 2023.
What are the key dates and times I need to know?
●
The deadline for applications to any Consortium school is Friday 11th November, 2022.
●
Test dates are one of Friday 2nd December, Tuesday 6th December and Thursday 8th December.
Candidates only sit the assessment once, irrespective of the number of Consortium schools to
which they are applying.
●
Offers will be sent out to arrive on Friday 10th February with acceptances due by Monday 6th
March at noon.
●
If she is sitting at a Consortium school, she may have either a morning or an afternoon
assessment on one of the three assessment dates. Schools will advise of the exact start time
for their sitting.
Why is the Consortium introducing a new test?
The Consortium wants to continue to assess mathematical and verbal ability, but also to assess deeper
thinking. We have worked very hard with our new test provider, ATOM Learning, to design creative new
questions to assess problem-solving and analysis skills, something our previous assessment did not do. We
believe that the new assessment is innovative as well as reliable and that candidates will find the
questions stimulating.
Who is designing the entr ance examination for the Consortium?
We have worked hard over the last 12 months designing a new assessment with ATOM Learning. We
selected ATOM as our new test provider because of their evident passion for assessment and ability to
innovate in this area. ATOM will be familiar to many primary schools through their online Maths and
English learning platform which provides children with opportunities to consolidate and extend their
skills in these two critical areas. The assessment designed for the Consortium is almost entirely bespoke
and designed in partnership with a group of primary and secondary curriculum specialists in Consortium
schools.
How long will the new Consortium exam take? How will candidates manage their time?
The new exam will be 100 minutes long (1 hour 40 minutes). There will be a 30-minute break in the
middle. During the exam, candidates will see a clock on their screen that will count down in minutes
showing them how long they have left for each section. It will be visible but not so large as to distract
them from their work. We have deliberately chosen for the clock not to count down in seconds as we
thought this might distract some candidates. They will not be given any additional time warnings.
What about candidates eligible for extr a time?
Candidates eligible for extra time will be asked to indicate their entitlement at the point of application
to Consortium schools. Admissions teams will then ask families to provide evidence of this entitlement,
just as we have done in the past, in accordance with JCQ rules. Candidates eligible for extra time will be
granted their extra time on each section of the exam rather than taking it all as one block of time. This
is because once a section has been completed, candidates cannot go back to amend it.
What will be tested in the new entr ance examination?
There will be five distinct components, taken in the following order:
●
20 minutes for Maths
●
10 minutes for Non-Verbal Reasoning
●
30 minutes for English comprehension and Verbal Reasoning
●
BREAK for 30 minutes
●
15 minutes for Problem Solving
●
25 minutes for the Analysis component
Is the assessment adaptive or non-adaptive? What does this mean?
The first three parts of the examination will be adaptive. The adaptive nature ensures every child can
have a good experience completing the assessment as the questions will be tailored to their
performance. Adaptive assessment is a tried and tested method of assessment that yields reliable
results, especially in assessing cognitive reasoning ability.
The final two sections of the examination (problem-solving and analysis) will be non-adaptive, meaning
all candidates will see exactly the same questions. The English comprehension passage will also be the
same but questions will be adaptive. We will change the non-adaptive parts for each of our three exam
days to ensure the security of the test.
I would like to know more about each section. What can you tell me?
You should look at the familiarisation materials on the Consortium website which will be available early
in the Autumn Term 2022 and will remain on the website thereafter. We hope the information below is
helpful to learn a little more about each section:
Maths section
The questions will be based on the National Curriculum for Year 5 and we will not test anything on the
Year 6 curriculum. This is to make things fair as different schools will teach the Year 6 curriculum in
different orders. Because we have many very able candidates taking the Consortium exam, we will
provide stretch and challenge through the style and depth of the questions we ask. This section is
adaptive
, with questions suited to the performance
of each candidate.
Non-Verbal Reasoning (NVR)
This will involve assessment of the candidate’s ability to identify patterns and think logically. NVR is a
tried and tested component of many cognitive reasoning assessments. The questions can seem strange to
candidates who have never seen those sorts of questions before, so we recommend that all candidates
look at our familiarisation materials. We do not, however, recommend intense preparation as any gains
quickly become very marginal. This section is
adaptive
(see above for an explanation).
English Comprehension and Verbal Reasoning
The text will be a piece of fiction specially written for the Consortium examination. Questions will be
adaptive depending on a candidate’s performance. There will be no extended writing required.
Candidates should not be thrown by vocabulary they do not know as one of the things we are assessing is
the ability to infer meaning from context. The questions are
adaptive
.
Comprehension will be followed by an assessment of a candidate’s ability to identify the correct use of
standard English in context. This section will not require any recall of grammar, and candidates who read
widely will be well prepared for this section.
Problem-solving
This section tests the ability of candidates to use words and numbers to solve multi-step problems. The
section is
non-adaptive
but candidates are likely
to complete different numbers of questions in the time
available.
Analysis component
Candidates have to use information from a variety of different sources to answer questions. The
information provided will be given to them in a range of different formats and they may have to look at
several different sources simultaneously to answer questions. The context is likely to be unfamiliar to all
candidates but in the event of a candidate being familiar with the context, this will not confer any
advantage on them. This section is
non-adaptive
.
Why are you offering three test dates? Why are all candidates not sitting the test on the
same day? Why are you not allowing the test to be taken within a certain timefr ame?
With our previous assessment during the pandemic, candidates were simply given a deadline by which
they had to have taken the assessment. Because some elements of our new London 11+ Consortium
assessment are non-adaptive, we cannot allow candidates to take the test whenever they wish. They
have to take it on one of three selected dates – 2nd, 6th or 8th December 2022. We have allowed three
dates to enable as many primary and prep schools to host the tests themselves as possible, giving them
flexibility to work around their calendars. To ensure security, different non-adaptive content has been
produced for each of the three sitting dates. Our Consortium schools will accommodate pupils who
cannot take the exam in their own school.
Why are you allowing some candidates to take the exam in their own school and some in
Consortium schools? Is this fair?
All schools will have to abide by strict rules set out by the Consortium to make things fair for all
candidates:
●
The exam must start within a certain time frame within the day. This is to preserve the
security of the exam.
●
The exam can only be taken on three selected dates – 2nd, 6th and 8th December.
●
The break must occur at the same point for ALL candidates - after the Verbal Reasoning
section. Candidates must resume the exam after a specified break duration of 30 minutes.
●
Only Consortium schools will be allowed to run afternoon sittings. We are allowing this to
increase capacity for candidates to take the assessment at Consortium schools if required, and
because our schools will ensure there is no possibility of afternoon candidates finding out the
questions from morning candidates.
Will the exam be the same on each of your three exam days?
The adaptive sections change for each candidate as they work their way through the relevant section of
the examination. This means that every candidate will answer different questions on the adaptive parts
of the assessment. The adaptive parts of the assessment are therefore intrinsically secure. As a reminder
these are: the Maths section, the Non Verbal and Verbal Reasoning section, as well as the questions (but
not the passage) on the English comprehension.
The non-adaptive sections will change for each of the three sittings of the exam: the comprehension
passage, the problem-solving and the analysis sections. This is to ensure that candidates do not gain any
advantage by sitting the test on a later test date. Results will be standardised across the three sittings to
ensure parity between candidates taking the assessment on different days. However, the pitch has been
carefully checked for all three sittings.
My daughter’ s school cannot offer her the facility to take the exam. What should I do?
Please do not worry! Whilst we hope that many schools will offer this facility as they did during the
pandemic, we recognise that not all schools have the capacity or time to do this. Consortium schools will
ask ALL families to indicate a 1st and 2nd choice Consortium exam centre after they apply. This is in case
their daughter’s school cannot host the exam for them. The 1st and 2nd choice must be a Consortium
school to which the family has applied.
The location at which a candidate sits the exam has
no bearing on the outcome
of the application.
Candidates should not be at any advantage whether sitting at a Consortium school or in their own school.
If sitting at a Consortium school, we do not mind which schools a family selects as their 1st and 2nd
preference exam centre, as long as they have made an application to both these schools.
My daughter’ s school is offering the facility to take the exam there but I would r ather she
sat at a Consortium school. Is this possible?
No. If your daughter’s school offers the facility for her to take the exam there, for important logistical
reasons we ask that you take up this facility. The ability to run an effective online assessment is
dependent on the number of available devices in each school, including in Consortium schools. We need
to keep our exam sittings free for those who can only take the exam in a Consortium school.
My daughter is an overseas applicant. Where will she take the exam?
Your daughter is welcome to travel to sit the test in one of our schools and please indicate to us if she
can do this. If you would prefer your daughter to sit the exam overseas, please contact the Admissions
team at one of your Consortium schools to find out how to proceed.
What if my daughter is ill on the day of the exam?
If your daughter is unwell on the day of her exam, please alert the Consortium schools to which she has
applied as a matter of urgency. A medical certificate will need to be provided to all the Consortium
schools to which she has applied. We will aim to organise for her to sit the exam on one of the other
exam dates. If this is not possible (for example because her test date was the last of the three possible
dates), we have contingency plans in place and you should liaise with the Consortium schools to which
she has applied to make arrangements.
What if my daughter is late on the day of her exam?
You should ensure you leave plenty of time for travel as we cannot guarantee being able to give your
daughter the full assessment time she needs if she arrives late. However, we do understand that
sometimes even the best-laid travel plans can go wrong and we aim to show kindness and flexibility
wherever possible.
Will the results affect whether my daughter is inv ited to interv iew at the schools to which
she has applied?
Some Consortium schools select for interview, and some do not. You need to check the details on the
individual schools’ websites. If the school selects for interview, how they make their decision and how
many candidates they invite to interview are matters at their discretion.
How much prepar ation does my daughter have to do for the Consortium entr ance
examination?
We recommend that all candidates look at the familiarisation materials, which will be available on our
website from early in the Autumn Term of 2022. Beyond that, our exam will test knowledge of the Year 5
Maths National Curriculum, and candidates will need to know how to read an extended passage of fiction
and answer questions on it. These are all skills that your daughter will be developing in school anyway, so
your daughter does not need special tuition or intensive practice for this assessment.
We actively discourage preparation for the interview. Our interviewers can easily identify the candidate
who has been coached for this part of the process. They are also experienced in putting nervous
candidates at their ease. We are looking for evidence of creative and independent thinking, and
suitability for our schools.
