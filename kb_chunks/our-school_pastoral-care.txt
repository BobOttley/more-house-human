At 
More House
, we place enormous value on the Form Tutor relationship with our pupils. There are two Form Tutors per form. This means that each pupil has been assigned one Form Tutor, who is the main point of contact for her and her parents. The Form Tutor maintains an overview of each pupil’s progress, both academic and personal, as well as providing day-to-day pastoral care.
With class sizes no larger than sixteen, our Form Tutors’ knowledge of the girls is second to none. Our proactive approach to tackling any issues that may arise creates a safe and warm environment in which pupils flourish.
