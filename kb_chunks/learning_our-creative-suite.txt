Our new Creative Suite, sporting five wall mounted energy efficient screens, adaptable work stations where students often stand instead of sitting, access to robotics, an abundance of Lego and four Cricut machines, is providing opportunities for all departments to explore, discover and create.
At More House, this new space marks a step towards the development of a curriculum that acknowledges that the confines of the standard classroom do not serve every child. As educators, we must work hard to provide opportunities for every child to engage creatively and critically with their learning.
This adaptable space is not only geared towards the teaching of Digital Skills, but opens up all sorts of possibilities for different departments to do things differently, from weather reports and model making in Geography, to set and lighting design with Lego in Drama and automated solutions in Business Studies.
We envisage the More House Creative Suite as a place of wonder â€“ without limits, but filled to the brim with possibility, critical exploration and courageous innovation. Even historically important buildings like ours can offer a taste of the future!
