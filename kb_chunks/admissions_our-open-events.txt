Discover the More House difference! We understand choosing the right school for your daughter can be a complex time, and we aim to make this part of the process as smooth as possible for you.
As you step through our doors, you will immediately experience our small school environment, where every student is truly known and nurtured. We pride ourselves on our outstanding pastoral care, ensuring our students’ well-being is paramount.
During your visit, you may see the focus and engagement in a dynamic science lesson or perhaps the collaborative problem-solving in a maths lesson. Beyond the core curriculum, as you journey through our corridors, you may hear the energy of drama rehearsals, see art studios buzzing with creativity, or find our students throwing themselves into all sorts of clubs and activities. For us, these enriching experiences, alongside our extensive co-curricular activities, are not just extras; they are woven into the very fabric of what we do here. Come and experience who we are by filling in the form below.
