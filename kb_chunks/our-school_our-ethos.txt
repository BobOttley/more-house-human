Living Our Catholic Ethos.
 More House’s Catholic faith isn’t just taught; it’s lived daily. We cultivate tolerant, just, and thoughtful girls who act with integrity. Daily prayer and weekly Chapel services build our community, celebrating St Thomas More’s Day and Days of Obligation.
Faith in Action (FIA) Drives Our Impact.
 Our core charitable work, FIA empowers pupils to lead local and global change. FIA mobilises campaigns on climate change, homelessness, and more, partnering with CAFOD, The Cardinal Hume Centre, The WE Foundation, and other organisations. We foster global citizens through active campaigning and international projects, from Tanzanian support to initiatives in Cambodia and Ecuador.
From the warmth of our local community to the awe-inspiring spaces of Notre Dame, Sacré Coeur, and the Vatican (where we performed for the beatification of Pope John Paul II), More House’s Music department travels the world, sharing our liturgy and creating memorable experiences. Our students, joined by alumni, bring a unique energy to every performance.
