Being in central London, More House is perfectly positioned to use all that the city has to offer as an extension of our school buildings. Our science labs are the London parks, the world-class museums are our exhibition halls and Londonâ€™s modes of public transport are our school corridors.
We make the best of all that London has to offer and we claim these special places as our own, providing as many opportunities as possible for our pupils to enjoy them, learn from them and think bigger than the four walls of their classrooms.
In Key Stage 3, pupils are taken off timetable once a half-term for a City Curriculum Day. These days are cross-curricular in nature and give our students the chance to explore what they are learning in lessons and to bring the outside world into their understanding of all they are discovering in school.
