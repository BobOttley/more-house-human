Bursaries
A limited number of bursaries are offered to pupils joining the school in Year 7 and thus will be in place before the academic year starts. Special governors’ bursaries may be awarded at any point in the academic year and will normally be in response to a particular set of circumstances, as well as having special provisions attached. Hardship bursaries are usually awarded only to girls already in the school and in examination years.
Parents who wish to apply for bursaries should contact our 
Director of Admissions and Marketing
 who will send you the Bursary Award Policy and Procedures.  The closing date for submission of all completed bursary applications, including financial disclosure of parental income and assets, needs to be completed by 30
th
 November.
Please note that bursaries do not include the Registration Fee, the Bursary Application fee, the Acceptance Deposit or any extras except for those stipulated if an award is made.
